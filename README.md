# Introduction

This is the code underlying the computer graphics art hosted at (placeholder).

# Usage

**js/three.js** should exist and be the header file for THREE.js.
**jslib/** should exist and be equal to the examples subdirectory in the three.js source code (https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/dev/examples)

A webserver can be run in this directory and serve these HTML files. The browser will render them, producing animations as appearing in the example images below.

To produce the animations involving Node.js modules, which is at the moment just random\_walk.html, the browserify tool is required.

# Drawings

## Sun Path

An interactive animation of the sun's path through the sky where latitude and longitude can be manually entered.

## Kitchen Sink

A hodgepodge of THREE.js features, useful as a example for how to correctly do various computer graphics tasks.

Sample Image : ![That sprite is me][images/stills/kitchen_sink]

## Template

The starting point of most of this art, including the web-page structure for a table of input and navigation of the camera in the scene.
